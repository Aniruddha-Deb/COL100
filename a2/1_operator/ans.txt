a)
	k = 1
	l = 0

b)
	z=0; x=2 (post increment uses the initial value in the expression)
	z=0; x=3 (evaluated as -(x++) + (++y))
	z=0 (x/(x+1), which is 0 because of integer division)

c)
	x = -13 (Unary operators have a higher precedence, so -3*4 = -12, -6/5 = -1)

d)
	x = 11 ((7+6)-5/2 = 13-5/2 = 13-2 = 11)

e)
	z,u,v,w = 2
	z,u,v,w = 3
	z = -4; u,v,w=3

f)
	z,u,v,w = 0
	z,u,v,w = 1
	z = 6; u,v,w=2
